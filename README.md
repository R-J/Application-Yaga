# Yaga

__Y__et __A__nother __G__amification __A__pplication is a Garden application that provides a gamification platform for other Garden applications. It integrates by default with Vanilla Forums. Out of the box, it provides Reactions, Badges, and Ranks.

It is released under the GPLv3 and may be released under a different license _**with permission**_.


## Installation

To get up and running with Yaga, either:

* __[Download the latest stable release](http://vanillaforums.org/get/yaga-application)__
* Clone the repository into the `applications` directory:

```sh
$ cd path-to-applications
$ git clone git://github.com/hgtonight/Application-Yaga.git yaga
```

> __NB:__ Make sure to double check that the installed folder is named `yaga`!

The latter option is only recommend if you're familiar with git.

Once you've added the application to your Vanilla installation, you need to activate and configure it in the dashboard. Once activated, you will see a new "Gamification" menu in the dashboard sidebar where you can configure each individual part of the Yaga application.
